                <br>
                <p>This is a JavaScript project</p>
                <br>
                <p>I made this project so you can add it with wallpaper engine</p>
                <br>
                <p>It uses your local time and displays an image depending on it, later on I also added an audio spectrum</p>

                <p>This is a JavaScript project</p>
                <br>
                <p>In this project a neural network will try to guess what color gradients you like</p>
                <br>
                <p>By clicking yes if you like it, no if you dislike it or kinda if you don't know the neural network will be trained locally to show you similar color combinations</p>

                <br>
                <p>A physics web simulation where you can create, modify and manage your own solar systems</p>
                <br>
                <p>You can set the initial position, velocity, mass, radius, color and more of every planet, also you can edit each planet's attributes and the general settings of the simulation</p>

                <p>This is a React project</p>
                <br>
                <p>Task lists are a very common begginer React app so I had to make my own</p>
                <br>
                <p>I did this application without using any other library like Material UI or TypeScript as a programming language, it's a plain React app with my own type of styling</p>

                <p>Chat with anybody connected to the backend through a smooth UI</p>
                <br>
                <p>I used Express and Socket IO for the backend communication and React, Material UI and Socket IO for the frontend, by cloning the repository you can create and modify your own version of the chat</p>

                <br>
                <p>Sometimes it gets hard to look on every games store to see if there is any free games</p>
                <br>
                <p>That's why I made a free games notifier where through a simple UI you can see a list of all the current free games available, to get the free games the program does a technique called web scraping</p>

                <p>This is a Python project</p>
                <br>
                <p>I made a object oriented modular Discord.py bot template wich can be used to create your own bots</p>
                <br>
                <p>Using this modular system you can add and remove functionalities by only dragging files in a folder, the bots can have connection to Twitch, Reddit, send images or even trigger events depending on the day and hour</p>
