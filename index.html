                <p>This is a custom Twitch "subathon" countdown for the streamer SugusSusana</p>
                <br>
                <p>A Twitch subathon countdown is a timer that starts at a certain time and decreases until it hits 0, but it has a twist, if a person subscribes or donates the timer will increase so the streamer will not be able to leave until the timer ends. This timer has connections with streamlabs and also streamloots wich does not have a public event API so I had to reverse engineer their alert system.</p>

                <br>
                <p>That's why I made a free games notifier where through a simple UI you can see a list of all the current free games available, to get the free games the program does a technique called web scraping</p>

                <p>By using this modular system you can add and remove functionalities by only dragging files in a folder, the bots can have connection to Twitch, Reddit, send images or even trigger events depending on the day and hour</p>
