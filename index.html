                <br>
                <p>I made some custom Twitch "subathon" counters for different content creators like <a href="https://twitter.com/littleragergirl" target="_blank">LittleRagerGirl</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/BersGamer" target="_blank">BersGamer</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/EvilAFM" target="_blank">Alexelcapo</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/SugusSusanaTW" target="_blank">SugusSusana</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/SoiDubi" target="_blank">SoyDubi</a></p>
                <br>
                <p>A Twitch subathon countdown is just a timer that will increase if someone subscribes or donates to the streamer's channel and if the timer hits 0 the stream ends. The timers I made had connections with Twitch, Streamlabs, StreamElements and even Streamloots wich does not have a public event API so I had to reverse engineer their alert system</p>

                <p>I made an object oriented modular Discord.py bot template which can be used to create your own bots</p>
                <br>
                <p>By using this modular system you can add and remove functionalities by only dragging files in a folder, the bots can have connection to Twitch, Reddit, send images or even trigger events depending on the day and hour</p>

                <br>
                <p>The idea was to improve the streamer Michael Reeves' Minecraft potato farm, I know it sounds dumb but the farm was made with a mod called ComputerCraft wich allows the player to code computers to perform certain actions. They can move, interact with the world, communicate between each other and even send http requests and websocket connections to the exterior. With that I created a facility with farming, vending machines, servers, databases, drone deployment and cryptocurrency from scratch</p>
